Prime number has 2 qualities all positive, all bigger than 1
              only factor are 1 and itself 
for number in range 2(,possible Prime):


number=1
divisor=2
remainder

If (number <2)
    Print "Its not prime!"
    Number +=1
    Process again
 If ( number =2)
      print "number is prime"
    Number+=1

If (number >2)
   (number<100) if yes stop
     remainder = number % Divisor 
    If (Remainder =0)
    number is not prime number
    number += 1 
    divisor2= 2
           process again
else

divisor +=1
If (number=divisor)
print "number is prime" ,number +=1 ,dividor=2, process again
else

process again
